### This is the public repo for my week 9 assignment. 

* I cloned the repo via SSH to my local machine, made my own branch separate from "masster" as a best practice, made edits, then saved the edits as a separate file. 
* I then used git add, git commit, git push origin branch to get my changes back here. 
* Then I acted as my own supervisor and merged my own pull request (Bad practice in reality, but this is a project of one person) then deleted the branch.
